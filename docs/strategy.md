# Strategy

Building a URL shortener project from scratch, until it becomes a solid system, is a challenge. Especially to build, break, fix and repeat the same process until the decent system design is built, is really hard. However, as we are starting this challenge, we accepted the battle request and are now preparing our own weapons.

The process will go on 8 steps:

0. Toy in-memory service
1. Migration to PostgreSQL
2. Better Code Generation & Dedupe Strategy
3. Addition of Caching for the Hot Path
4. Rate Limiting & Abuse Protections
5. Analytics (without killing the hot path)
6. Production-Grade Serving
7. Horizontal Scaling & Data Partitioning
